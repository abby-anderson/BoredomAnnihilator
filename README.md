# Boredom Annihilator
Do you want to do something fun, but you need some inspiration? Let our boredom annihilator help!


## How to use
Click 'Annihilate my Boredom!' to generate new activities. 

Not vibing with a selection? Just click the delete button to get rid of it. 

Have you completed one of our activities? Click the done button to mark it as complete. Woo! This will move it to the completed activities section of the page, and it will also save it to your list of completed activities. After completing an activity, try refreshing the page--you'll see it persists in the list of completed activities!

Maybe you want to save a few to do this fall, or a handful seem like good inspo for a date night. Just click the save button on those activities to gather them up, then type in a name like 'To do this weekend' or 'Date night inspo!' and click the submit button. You'll see they move over to the section of the page dedicated to showing your saved lists. 

### Setup
